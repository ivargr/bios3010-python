# Setup
We recommend trying to write Python locally on your computer if possible. 
If you don't have Python installed, we recommend using Anaconda to install it, by following  [this guide](https://lexnederbragt.github.io/python-novice-MBV3070-H19/setup/).



# Exercises
Note: Exercise 2 and 3 are similar, but Exercise 3 is more difficult. Choose on of them depending on your skill level. 
One option is to try Exercise 2 first, and then do Exercise 3 if you find Exercise 2 easy.
